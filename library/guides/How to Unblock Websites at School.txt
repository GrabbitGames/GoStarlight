How to Unblock Websites at School
Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)

What It Does: A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a remote server, making it difficult for anyone (including your school’s network administrators) to monitor your browsing activity.
How to Use It:
Download a VPN app or browser extension (like NordVPN, ProtonVPN, or TunnelBear).
Connect to a server (usually you can pick one from any country).
Once connected, try accessing the website you want to visit.
Note: Some schools may block VPN connections, so this may not always work.
Use a Proxy Website

What It Does: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the website you're trying to visit. The website sees the proxy server’s IP, not your own, which can bypass restrictions.
How to Use It:
Go to a proxy site like Hide.me, KProxy, or ProxySite.
Enter the URL of the blocked website.
The proxy will fetch the website for you.
Note: Proxies can be slow and unreliable, and many proxies are blocked by schools.
Use HTTPS Instead of HTTP

What It Does: Some schools may block websites using the “http” protocol, but allow “https” sites. Try changing “http” to “https” in the URL and see if it works.
How to Use It:
For example, change http://example.com to https://example.com and try loading the website.
Note: This method is often effective for some restricted sites.
Use Google Translate as a Proxy

What It Does: Google Translate can be used as an intermediary between you and the website you want to visit.
How to Use It:
Go to https://translate.google.com.
Enter the URL of the blocked site in the text box.
Select any language (it can be any language, as it doesn't affect the website’s content).
Click the translated link, and it should open the site through Google Translate.
Note: This works because Google Translate acts as a proxy server.
Use Browser Extensions

What It Does: Browser extensions like Hola VPN, ZenMate, or Proxy Switcher can allow you to access restricted sites.
How to Use It:
Download the extension from the browser’s store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.).
Activate it to mask your IP and access blocked content.
Note: Extensions may be blocked by school administrators, and some can have security risks.
Use a Mobile Hotspot

What It Does: If the school’s network restricts websites, you can use your phone’s mobile data to bypass the restrictions.
How to Use It:
Enable the mobile hotspot on your phone.
Connect your laptop or device to the mobile hotspot.
Browse the internet as usual, bypassing the school network restrictions.
Note: Using mobile data can consume a lot of bandwidth, and some schools may consider this against their rules.
Use the Tor Browser

What It Does: The Tor browser anonymizes your internet traffic and can help you bypass network restrictions. It routes your connection through multiple servers, making it hard for anyone to track or block your activity.
How to Use It:
Download and install the Tor browser from torproject.org.
Use Tor to visit any website that is blocked.
Note: Tor can be slower than other browsing methods, and some schools block access to it.
Try Using a Different DNS

What It Does: DNS (Domain Name System) servers are responsible for resolving website URLs into IP addresses. Some DNS servers (like Google DNS or Cloudflare) can bypass restrictions if the school uses a restrictive DNS.
How to Use It:
Go to your device’s network settings and change the DNS server to:
Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
Once done, try accessing the website again.
Note: This may not always work, as many schools block external DNS servers.
Use a URL Shortener

What It Does: Some URL shorteners, like Bitly or TinyURL, can bypass restrictions by hiding the full URL.
How to Use It:
Go to a URL shortening service like https://bitly.com or https://tinyurl.com.
Paste the blocked website’s URL and generate a short link.
Try visiting the short URL.
Note: Some schools may detect and block shortened URLs, so this may not always be effective.
Important Considerations:
School Policies: Always check with your school’s rules. Unblocking websites might be a violation of their acceptable use policies, which could lead to consequences like account suspension or device confiscation.
Security Risks: Some methods, like using proxies or VPNs from unknown sources, can expose you to security risks, such as malware, tracking, or data theft. Always use reputable services and be cautious.
Focus on Learning: It’s important to remember that the purpose of the school's restrictions is to keep students focused on their studies. If you're trying to access websites for educational purposes, you could consider asking your teacher or administrator for permission to access the site.
